# Out-CLI

Out-CLI is a custom command-line application built with Go, born out of the need for a more personalized and intuitive way to manage directories and files on Windows. The motivation behind creating this tool was simple: I wanted to replace the default Windows commands with my own custom commandsâ€”ones that are easier for me to remember and use. Over time, this project has become a way for me to tailor the command-line experience to my preferences, allowing me to add new commands whenever I need them, without relying on or struggling to recall the official Windows commands.
